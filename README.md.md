### What I learned

I learned a couple of things while working on this challenge
like the flex properties an how to center and element
.flex{
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; -- to positon flex element horizontally
  align-content:center;
  flex-direction: column; --used to specify the direction of flex elements
}
To center an element
we set the width of the body to 50% and set the marging to be auto for equal amount of marging on both sides
